# 🧠 T5 Disease Prediction & Medical Precaution Generator

This project fine-tunes a **T5-small model** to predict the most likely disease and recommend medical precautions based on input symptoms.  
The model is trained on a dataset combining disease names, symptoms, and precaution instructions.

---

## 🚑 Features
- Input symptoms → Output **Disease & Precautions**
- Model trained on local medical dataset
- Works with Mac M1 (MPS) and CPU
- Supports inference/prediction function
